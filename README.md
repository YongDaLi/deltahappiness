# Quotes
> Emma S.: Why wouldn't the witch just do it for the memes?

> Yong Da: Viagra should be kind of like coffee.

> Jose: [*in a sad voice*] it's just one more app

> Emma S.: Do you want to play "Who is Afraid of the Black Man"?

> Emma S.: [*on the topic of grocery stores closing early*] Yeah see Zurich is actually really great, cause other cantons have much stricter opening hour laws. In a lot of cantons all stores close at 7PM. There was a referendum In Zug to have longer opening hours two years ago but 65% of people said no.

# Very important questions to discuss

You people gotta add stuff here I already added the great excursion ideas. 

But also if someone you loved was killed in front of you, but someone created a copy of them that was perfect right down to the atomic level, would they be the same person and would you love them just as much? 
Oh, and also what would you genetically change about humans to make them a better species?

How transactional are human relationships? And how transactional should they be?

Selling out to the US military industrial complex?

Best names for their profession/job? Ex. if Stephen Curry worked at an Indian restaurant.

What would a potential future culture and political system look like on a Mars colony?

Perfect number of people for a:
- camping trip
- ski trip
- orgy
- dinner party

Weirdest thing someone can pull out of their pocket?

Absolute power corrupts absolutely?

Is history decided by "great men" (aka individual people) or the masses?

How much should drugs/medicine, technology, and statistics be allowed in sports? 
- example drugs/medicine: Tour de France doping
- example technology: Nike AlphaFly shoe or full-body swims suits
- example statistics: A basketball team only runs 5x plays because they are the most efficient/highest scoring plays, leading to boring spectatorship, leading to less money into the league.

How much social media should celebrities engage in?

Lossless data compression is the same problem as general artificial intelligence. Discuss.

Regardless of culture, socio-economic status, and period in history, what are constants in the human condition?

If you could see the future and know that you'll have a child who dies at age 10, would you still have the child?
