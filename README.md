# Quotes
> Emma S.: Why wouldn't the witch just do it for the memes?

> Yong Da: Viagra should be kind of like coffee.

> Jose: [*in a sad voice*] it's just one more app

> Emma S.: Do you want to play "Who is Afraid of the Black Man"?

> Emma S.: [*on the topic of grocery stores closing early*] Yeah see Zurich is actually really great, cause other cantons have much stricter opening hour laws. In a lot of cantons all stores close at 7PM. There was a referendum In Zug to have longer opening hours two years ago but 65% of people said no.

> Arthur: I want to invite you all for a dinner party at my place where I make Borscht. But there are two problems. I don't have enough space for everyone and I don't know how to make Borscht.

> Arthur [on the topic of whether you would wear the same underwear for 1 week or the same socks for 30 days]: Bro how could you choose socks. You sweat in them everyday. Just clean yourself really nicely for one week, live hygenic, don't subject yourself to sin and you will be fine. Dude imagine the sturdiness and the smell of the socks after 3 weeks ðŸ’€

> Yong Da [after putting chicken stock and water+gin in his water bottle during skiing]: Also quick side note, my water bottle now faintly smells of chicken stock and gin. And I canâ€™t wash it out. ðŸ¥²
